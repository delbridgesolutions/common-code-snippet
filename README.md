# MongoDB Development Best Practices: A Code Repository

This repository contains a collection of code snippets and scripts demonstrating best practices for developing scalable and performant applications with MongoDB. The examples are derived from real-world case studies, addressing common challenges faced by development teams.

## 1\. Data Modeling & Schema Design

[cite\_start]Effective data modeling is crucial for application performance[cite: 277]. [cite\_start]These examples showcase flexible schema design patterns to solve complex business problems[cite: 277, 287].

### `src/data-modeling/hr_chatbot_schema.js`

[cite\_start]This file contains a multi-collection schema design for an HR intelligent chatbot[cite: 277]. It demonstrates the use of:

  * [cite\_start]**Embedded Documents**: To store frequently accessed data like `skills` and `projects` directly within the `User` document, minimizing read operations[cite: 290, 291].
  * [cite\_start]**Document Referencing**: For modeling many-to-many relationships between collections like `User` and `Projects`[cite: 293].
  * [cite\_start]**Time-Series Collections**: For efficient, high-volume storage and querying of immutable data like chat messages[cite: 296].

### `src/data-modeling/schema_validation.js`

[cite\_start]A script to enforce data consistency in a flexible schema environment[cite: 511, 514]. It uses MongoDB's `$jsonSchema` operator to:

  * [cite\_start]Validate incoming documents at the database level[cite: 519, 520].
  * [cite\_start]Find existing documents that do not conform to a predefined schema[cite: 522], which is essential for data migration and cleanup.

## 2\. Performance & Cost Optimization

These scripts focus on automating performance tuning and resource management to ensure long-term efficiency.

### `src/performance-optimization/index_build_optimization.js`

This script provides a solution for intelligent index creation. It automates the process of:

  * [cite\_start]Calculating the **cardinality** of fields to be indexed[cite: 366].
  * [cite\_start]Generating optimal compound index creation commands by sorting fields from high to low cardinality[cite: 358, 368].

### `src/performance-optimization/cursor_based_pagination.js`

[cite\_start]A demonstration of the best practice for building scalable pagination[cite: 249]. [cite\_start]It shows how to use a **cursor-based** approach with `_id` or other ordered fields to avoid the performance pitfalls of traditional `$skip` and `$limit` pagination on large datasets[cite: 242, 244]. [cite\_start]This method ensures consistent query performance regardless of page depth[cite: 273].

### `src/performance-optimization/auto_iops_scaling.js`

An advanced script for managing MongoDB Atlas costs and performance. This code, designed as an Atlas Serverless Function, demonstrates how to:

  * [cite\_start]Retrieve current cluster configurations via the Atlas API[cite: 454].
  * [cite\_start]Dynamically calculate target IOPS based on business logic and a predefined schedule[cite: 455].
  * [cite\_start]Use a `PATCH` request to automatically adjust the cluster's IOPS [cite: 456][cite\_start], addressing a key limitation where Atlas's native autoscaling does not include IOPS[cite: 446].

### `src/performance-optimization/health_check_script.js`

[cite\_start]A diagnostic script for database health checks[cite: 565]. [cite\_start]It automates the collection of key metrics to provide visibility into a database's internal state[cite: 555], including:

  * [cite\_start]`dataSize` and `totalIndexSize` to identify storage inefficiencies[cite: 569, 571].
  * [cite\_start]`averageDocumentSize` to evaluate the effectiveness of the data model[cite: 572].
  * [cite\_start]These metrics are crucial for proactive management and capacity planning[cite: 606, 608].

## 3\. Real-Time Data Synchronization

[cite\_start]These examples focus on building robust, event-driven architectures for real-time data flow[cite: 111].

### `src/data-sync/atlas_triggers_sync.js`

A solution using MongoDB Atlas Triggers and Serverless Functions to handle data synchronization. This code automates the process of:

  * [cite\_start]Listening for database change events (insert, update, delete) in a source collection[cite: 112].
  * [cite\_start]Automatically executing a serverless function to replicate or update data in a target collection, solving data consistency issues that arise from using embedded models[cite: 116, 148].

### `src/data-sync/change_stream_resumability.js`

[cite\_start]This code snippet demonstrates the resilience of MongoDB Change Streams[cite: 151]. It shows how to use a `resume token` to:

  * [cite\_start]Persist a specific point in the data stream[cite: 155].
  * [cite\_start]Seamlessly re-establish a connection and continue processing from the last successfully processed event after an interruption[cite: 156, 158]. [cite\_start]This ensures data integrity and prevents data loss in the face of transient failures[cite: 158].
