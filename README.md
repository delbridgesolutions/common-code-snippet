## 1\. Data Modeling & Schema Design

Effective data modeling is crucial for application performance. These examples showcase flexible schema design patterns to solve complex business problems.

### `hr_chatbot_schema.js`

This file contains a multi-collection schema design for an HR intelligent chatbot. It demonstrates the use of:

  * **Embedded Documents**: To store frequently accessed data like `skills` and `projects` directly within the `User` document, minimizing read operations.
  * **Document Referencing**: For modeling many-to-many relationships between collections like `User` and `Projects`. This approach maintains data flexibility and consistency.
  * **Time-Series Collections**: For efficient, high-volume storage and querying of immutable data like chat messages.

### `schema_validation.js`

A script to enforce data consistency in a flexible schema environment. It uses MongoDB's `$jsonSchema` operator to define rules and enforce data structure and type constraints at the database level. This allows developers to validate incoming documents at the database level and find existing documents that do not conform to a predefined schema, which is essential for data migration and cleanup.

## 2\. Performance & Cost Optimization

These scripts focus on automating performance tuning and resource management to ensure long-term efficiency.

### `find_unused_indexes.js`

Proactively managing indexes is challenging, as new ones may be added while older ones become deprecated. Indexes have a significant impact on write performance, as every time a collection is written, the relevant indexes need to be updated. While insufficient indexes immediately slow down queries, unused indexes are more subtle and need to be proactively deleted to improve write performance. Starting from MongoDB version 3.2, the official `$indexStats` aggregation operator allows you to obtain index usage statistics to locate long-unused indexes.

### `index_build_optimization.js`

Indexes are a powerful tool for improving query speed, but incorrect design can backfire. An inappropriate composite index field order can directly affect query performance. This script provides a solution that leverages data cardinality to create intelligent indexes. The core idea is to place the fields with the highest cardinality at the beginning of the composite index, which can narrow the search scope more quickly and improve query speed.

### `cursor_based_pagination.js`

Traditional pagination with `$skip` and `$limit` has serious performance issues. Query time increases linearly with page depth, and high resource consumption can affect overall system performance. In collections where data changes frequently, `$skip` can lead to duplicate or missed documents. The best practice is to adopt **cursor-based pagination**. This method maintains stable performance regardless of page depth, requires no time-consuming skipping operations, and ensures data integrity even with real-time data changes.

### `auto_iops_scaling.js`

Many business systems face the **tidal nature of workloads**, where high throughput is required during peak hours, and load drops sharply at other times. Maintaining IOPS at a peak level leads to resource waste and high costs, while keeping it low causes performance bottlenecks. **MongoDB Atlas's autoscaling feature currently does not include automatic scaling of IOPS**. This script uses the MongoDB Atlas API to dynamically adjust the cluster's IOPS based on business cycles. The core idea is to automatically increase IOPS during peak periods and reduce it during non-peak periods to achieve the best balance between performance and cost.

### `health_check_script.js`

In application development, a lack of visibility into internal database statistics, such as data distribution and resource consumption, can lead to serious performance and cost issues. This script addresses this by automatically obtaining detailed statistics for databases and collections. The script provides key metrics including `dataSize`, `storageSize`, `totalIndexSize`, `count`, and `averageDocumentSize`. Analyzing these metrics helps identify issues like unexpected storage growth or inefficient indexing.

## 3\. Real-Time Data Synchronization

These examples focus on building robust, event-driven architectures for real-time data flow.

### `atlas_triggers_sync.js`

Data inconsistency is a major challenge with embedded data models. Manually updating all embedded documents when source data changes increases development costs and leads to data inconsistencies. The solution is to use MongoDB Atlas Triggers, which leverage MongoDB's Change Streams technology to monitor database events in real time. The trigger automatically executes a serverless function to update the corresponding embedded data in the target collection, creating a fully automatic, event-driven background task.

### `change_stream_resumability.js`

Modern applications increasingly rely on real-time data streaming, but unexpected interruptions can lead to data loss and inconsistency. To solve this, MongoDB Change Streams introduces a `Resume Token` mechanism. This token marks the position of a specific event in the stream, allowing the application to continue sending data from the last successfully processed event. This ensures the data flow can be restored seamlessly without any data loss, guaranteeing the integrity and consistency of data processing.
